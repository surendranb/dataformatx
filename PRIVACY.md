# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2024

**DataFormatX** is designed with a "Local-First" architecture. 

## 1. Data Processing
*   **Local Processing:** All data parsing and UI rendering happens locally in your browser or on your machine.
*   **AI Processing:** 
    *   If you use **Local LLMs** (e.g., Ollama, LM Studio), your data **never** leaves your network.
    *   If you use **Gemini** or **OpenAI**, your data is sent strictly to those API providers for the purpose of conversion and is subject to their respective privacy policies.

## 2. Data Storage
*   **API Keys:** Your API keys are stored in your browser's `localStorage`. They are never sent to any server other than the AI provider (Google/OpenAI).
*   **Files:** We do not store, log, or cache the files you convert.

## 3. Analytics
This CLI tool does not track usage or collect telemetry data.
